# Natural Language Processing-Agatha Christie Novel
Hello, welcome to my project on NLP on word-level predictive model based on Agatha Christie's novel "Poirot Investigates"!

Datafile is saved as text file under name "NLP.txt". Download it and save on your local system and change the filepath in the code file accordingly.

All work is done in Python using Jupyter notebook. Please ensure you have all the required libraries (as mentioned under section "importing required libraries") installed on your system before running the code.

LSTM model with Embedding layer is being built and trained. I have saved the pre-trained model alongwith weights as well as tokeniser for direct use. Enjoy!
